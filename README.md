# bestBlog
it's the best ever blog now


### Setup
gonna need some pip stuff:
- Flask. That's it right now.

we got us some npm now, so see here first we do an `npm install`

and then we do a dang ole `npm run build`

and then we make it do a `python blog.py` if you don't want none of that terminal to be available no more

### Design Notes

Figure out url changes and routing in react for single page stuff

#### Main Blog
- RSS feed
- Post navigation (search/by date)
- post  snippets instead of the whole thing on the main page? (i.e. read more)
- Paging of results - "new page" or lazy loading?
- Design a header - or a sticky sidebar?
- The dreaded question: *do we need a footer?*

#### Posts
- Titles are clickable to each blog for full view (whole post? and comments)
- Post formatting - markdown or html? or a wysiwyg editor? same for comments.

#### Comments
- Nested comments
- Moderated comments?
